 we had a codewars that is about reversing the array. We used reverse() method.
I learned to use @media screen and (max-width: 640px)
to make everything for mobile phone. I also learned how to use icon-font
  <div class="icon-menu"></div>
  .icon-menu:before {
	content: "\e902";
}
I learned that I can convert string with split function to array. I also learn how to use splice methods.Splice methods get 3 parameters
splice(index, remove number,"inserted element")
num = num.toString().split("");
